# NATS Roadmap

This document is the NATS.io product roadmap for some of the key features our team plan to deliver in the near future.  Only high level issues and features are listed; weâ€™ll always continue work on minor enhancements that may not be listed here.

_We are currently working through a detailed process of prioritizing goals and issues to create a well defined release schedule for the short term, and to provide a more detailed roadmap for your long term planning.  __Expect an update in Q4 2017.__ _
