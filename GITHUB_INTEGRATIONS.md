# GitHub Integrations

NATS is a CNCF project and no one company has exclusive privileged rights to integrations in GitHub for the various [nats-io](https://github.com/nats-io/) repositories.

At the same time, many of the NATS Maintainers are employed by one company.
We want to be fair in how we manage the integrations.

## Integrations: Approval

Any NATS Maintainer can approve new GitHub integrations for any repositories under their purview.

## Integrations: Policy

Loosely, any organization which is contributing constructively towards NATS development can get a webhook added.
File an Issue describing the webhook and be ready to convey any credentials out of band.
